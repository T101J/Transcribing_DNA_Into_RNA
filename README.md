# Transcribing_DNA_Into_RNA
An RNA string can be represented using an alphabet as {“A”, “U”, “G”, “C”}. A DNA string can be converted to its corresponding transcribed RNA string by replacing all occurrences of “T” in the DNA string with “U”. Source code is from https://towardsdatascience.com as part of their "Starting off in Bioinformatics" article.

Both DNA and RNA strands are a sequence of nucleotides.

The four nucleotides found in DNA are adenine (A), cytosine (C), guanine (G) and thymidine (T).

The four nucleotides found in RNA are adenine (A), cytosine (C), guanine (G) and uracil (U).

Given a DNA strand, its transcribed RNA strand is formed by replacing each nucleotide with its complement:

- #### C -> G
- #### T -> A 
- #### A -> U 
- #### G -> C
